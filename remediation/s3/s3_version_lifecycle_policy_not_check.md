To fix the compliance issue regarding S3 Versioning and Lifecycle Policies, follow the steps below:

1. **Enable S3 Versioning:**

   - Choose the desired S3 bucket.
   - Click on the "Properties" tab.
   - In the "Bucket settings for versioning" card, click "Enable versioning".
   - Click "Save changes" to apply the setting.

   For more details on enabling versioning, refer to the official AWS documentation on [Managing Object Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EnableVersioning.html).

2. **Create and Configure S3 Lifecycle Policies:**
   - Navigate to the S3 console in the AWS Management Console.
   - Choose the desired S3 bucket.
   - Click on the "Management" tab.

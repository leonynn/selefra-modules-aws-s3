In order to comply with the "Ensure that S3 buckets have an active backup plan to protect against data loss and ensure seamless data recovery" policy, you should enable Amazon S3 versioning and configure Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to create a backup of the objects in the S3 bucket.

**Step 1: Enable Amazon S3 Versioning**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at the [S3 dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Select the bucket you want to enable versioning on.
3. Click on the 'Properties' tab.
4. Scroll down to the 'Bucket Versioning' card and click 'Edit'.
5. Check the 'Enable' option for 'Bucket versioning status'.
6. Click 'Save changes'.

For more information on Amazon S3 Versioning, please refer to the official [AWS documentation on managing versioning for objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/manage-object-versions.html).

**Step 2: Configure Amazon S3 Lifecycle Policies**

1. Go to the [S3 dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) and select the bucket you want to configure a Lifecycle policy for.
2. Click on the 'Management' tab.
3. In the 'Lifecycle policies' card, click 'Create lifecycle rule'.
4. Enter a rule name and apply rule scope (entire bucket or specific tags).
5. Under 'Actions on objects', you can configure transitions, expiration, or reset the storage class. In this case, configure the transitions to create a backup in another storage class, like the Glacier or Deep Archive storage class, after a specific number of days.
6. Click 'Create rule'.

To comply with the policy "Ensure all S3 buckets exposed to the Internet have proper security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access", follow these recommendations:

1. Use Amazon S3 Block Public Access at the account level or the bucket level to prevent new public access to S3 resources. For more details, check the [official documentation on S3 Block Public Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/block-public-access.html).

2. Review your bucket policies and ACLs to ensure that they are correctly configured and do not provide any unintentional public access. Refer to the [official documentation on managing access to an Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/manage-bucket-access.html).

3. Enable S3 access logging to monitor requests to your bucket and identify potential security issues. For more information, follow the [official guide on server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html).

4. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to define the specific actions and resources that a user or a group of users are allowed to access. For more information, refer to the [official documentation on IAM policies for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/setting-restriction-on-user-access.html).

5. Enable Amazon S3 Object Ownership to simplify managing object ownership in your bucket. This feature allows you to specify that all new objects uploaded to your bucket are owned by the bucket owner. Check the [official documentation for managing object ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) for more details.

By applying these recommendations, you should be able to prevent unauthorized access to your S3 buckets and ensure compliance with the aforementioned policy.
